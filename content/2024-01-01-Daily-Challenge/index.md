Today I have done leetcode's [January LeetCoding Challenge](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/) with `cpp`.

# January LeetCoding Challenge 1

## Description

**Assign Cookies**

<p>Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.</p>

<p>Each child <code>i</code> has a greed factor <code>g[i]</code>, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie <code>j</code> has a size <code>s[j]</code>. If <code>s[j] &gt;= g[i]</code>, we can assign the cookie <code>j</code> to the child <code>i</code>, and the child <code>i</code> will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= g.length &lt;= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 3 * 10<sup>4</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= g[i], s[j] &lt;= 2<sup>31</sup> - 1</code></li>
</ul>


## Solution

``` cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
    sort(g.begin(), g.end());
    sort(s.begin(), s.end());
    int posG = g.size() - 1;
    int posS = s.size() - 1;
    int answer = 0;
    while(posG >= 0 && posS >= 0) {
      while(posG >= 0 && s[posS] < g[posG]) posG -= 1;
      if(posG < 0) break;
      answer += 1;
      posS -= 1;
      posG -= 1; 
    }
    return answer;
  }
};
