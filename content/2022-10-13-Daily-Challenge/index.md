Today I have done leetcode's [October LeetCoding Challenge](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-linked-list/) with `cpp`.

# October LeetCoding Challenge 13

## Description

**Delete Node in a Linked List**

There is a singly-linked list `head` and we want to delete a node `node` in it.

You are given the node to be deleted `node`. You will **not be given access** to the first node of `head`.

All the values of the linked list are **unique**, and it is guaranteed that the given node `node` is not the last node in the linked list.

Delete the given node. Note that by deleting the node, we do not mean removing it from memory. We mean:

- The value of the given node should not exist in the linked list.
- The number of nodes in the linked list should decrease by one.
- All the values before `node` should be in the same order.
- All the values after `node` should be in the same order.

**Custom testing:**

- For the input, you should provide the entire linked list `head` and the node to be given `node`. `node` should not be the last node of the list and should be an actual node in the list.
- We will build the linked list and pass the node to your function.
- The output will be the entire list after calling your function.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/node1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/01/node2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
Output: [4,5,9]
Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[2, 1000]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- The value of each node in the list is **unique**.
- The `node` to be deleted is **in the list** and is **not a tail** node.

## Solution

``` cpp
class Solution {
public:
  void deleteNode(ListNode* node) {
    while(node->next && node->next->next) {
      node->val = node->next->val;
      node = node->next;
    }
    node->val = node->next->val;
    node->next = nullptr;
  }
};

// Accepted
// 41/41 cases passed (4 ms)
// Your runtime beats 99.95 % of cpp submissions
// Your memory usage beats 73.12 % of cpp submissions (7.5 MB)
```
