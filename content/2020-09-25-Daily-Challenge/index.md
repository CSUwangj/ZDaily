My answer:
  - move `Accepting all insurance plans` close to `Welcoming new patients`
  - left align them
  - left align Title and subtitle
  - align picture and the title
  - align service with location
  - align service with information
  - phone number all in one row
  - details align in same rows which looks like transparent blocks
  - align website with title
  - right align title and `Specialty Service`
  - left align picture and and `Family Medicine` text
  - add picture in background so it looks not so empty
  - use same font for website so it looks more harmonious
  - add background for website so it differ from the detailed service information, 
and also it's a repeat
  - all text use left align except website location
  - larger title
  - larger picture

ok, right answer has less alignment things, on correct rate I got 5/12, on recall rate I got 5/17. I need more practice.
