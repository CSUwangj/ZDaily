# November LeetCoding Challenge 14

## Description

**Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store**

<p>You are given an integer <code>n</code> indicating there are <code>n</code> specialty retail stores. There are <code>m</code> product types of varying amounts, which are given as a <strong>0-indexed</strong> integer array <code>quantities</code>, where <code>quantities[i]</code> represents the number of products of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> product type.</p>

<p>You need to distribute <strong>all products</strong> to the retail stores following these rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A store can only be given <strong>at most one product type</strong> but can be given <strong>any</strong> amount of it.</li>
	<li>After distribution, each store will have been given some number of products (possibly <code>0</code>). Let <code>x</code> represent the maximum number of products given to any store. You want <code>x</code> to be as small as possible, i.e., you want to <strong>minimize</strong> the <strong>maximum</strong> number of products that are given to any store.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <em>the minimum possible</em> <code>x</code>.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 6, quantities = [11,6]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One optimal way is:
- The 11 products of type 0 are distributed to the first four stores in these amounts: 2, 3, 3, 3
- The 6 products of type 1 are distributed to the other two stores in these amounts: 3, 3
The maximum number of products given to any store is max(2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) = 3.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 7, quantities = [15,10,10]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation:</strong> One optimal way is:
- The 15 products of type 0 are distributed to the first three stores in these amounts: 5, 5, 5
- The 10 products of type 1 are distributed to the next two stores in these amounts: 5, 5
- The 10 products of type 2 are distributed to the last two stores in these amounts: 5, 5
The maximum number of products given to any store is max(5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5) = 5.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 1, quantities = [100000]
<strong>Output:</strong> 100000
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The only optimal way is:
- The 100000 products of type 0 are distributed to the only store.
The maximum number of products given to any store is max(100000) = 100000.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>m == quantities.length</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= m &lt;= n &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= quantities[i] &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
</ul>


## Solution

``` cpp
class Solution {
  bool check(int n, int x, const vector<int>& quantities) {
    for(auto q : quantities) {
      n -= q / x + !!(q % x);
    }
    return n >= 0;
  }
public:
  int minimizedMaximum(int n, vector<int>& quantities) {
    int low = 1;
    int high = *max_element(quantities.begin(), quantities.end());
    while(low < high) {
      int mid = (low + high) / 2;
      if(check(n, mid, quantities)) {
        high = mid;
      } else {
        low = mid + 1;
      }
    }
    return low;
  }
};
```
