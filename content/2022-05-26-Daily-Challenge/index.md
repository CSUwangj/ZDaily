Today I have done leetcode's [May LeetCoding Challenge](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/) with `cpp`.

# May LeetCoding Challenge 26

## Description

**Number of 1 Bits**

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned  integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer  type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's  internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or  unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The input must be a **binary string** of length `32`.

 

**Follow up:** If this function is called many times, how would you optimize it?

## Solution

``` cpp
const uint32_t m1 = 0x55555555;
const uint32_t m2 = 0x33333333;
const uint32_t m4 = 0x0F0F0F0F;
const uint32_t m8 = 0x00FF00FF;
const uint32_t m16 = 0x0000FFFF;
class Solution { 
public:
  int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
    n = (n & m1) + ((n >> 1) & m1);
    n = (n & m2) + ((n >> 2) & m2);
    n = (n & m4) + ((n >> 4) & m4);
    n = (n & m8) + ((n >> 8) & m8);
    n = (n & m16) + ((n >> 16) & m16);
    return n;
  }
};
