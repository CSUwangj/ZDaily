Today I've been reading [A Tutorial on Linear and Differential Cryptanalysis](https://www.engr.mun.ca/~howard/PAPERS/ldc_tutorial.pdf) and finally finish reading it. I've found more interesting stuff like [The Amazing King - Linear Cryptanalysis Tutorial](http://www.theamazingking.com/crypto-linear.php) [The Amazing King - Differential Cryptanalysis Tutorial](http://www.theamazingking.com/crypto-diff.php)

Still there will be only some casual notes.

<!--more-->

> Linear cryptanalysis tries to take advantage of high probability occurrences of linear expressions involving plaintext bits, ciphertext bits, and subkey bits.
> 
> Differential cryptanalysis exploits the high probability of certain occurrences of plaintext differences and differences into the last round of the cipher.

It's easy to distinguish these two techniques when you know what they are doing.



I've been suffering at crypto challenge at rest of my relaxing time, so. ;_;
