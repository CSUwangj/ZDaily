Today is Sunday, so I decided to review the challenges I've done this week.

<!-- more -->

my second answer of example on P18-19:
  - remove the underline, underline is always a bad choice, see P154.
  - change the font of the title.
  - use lowercase for the rest of the title.
  - use smaller font os there is more space.
  - use different font-weight for dish name and description.

reference answer is one more difference:
  - don't use uppercase for all text in the main body.

my second answer of example on P22: 
  - reduce the picture size to leave space.
  - change the text to remove repeated content.
  - shorten the distance between bullets and items.
  - separate contact information.
  - remove unnecessary `Phone:`/`Fax:`.

reference answer:
  - shorten the distance between bullets and items.
  - add space between pictures to separate them.
  - the text needs to be separated from photos.
  - to separate from photos, location, and contact information need more space.
  - this poster is crowded on both sides, but there is a lot of space at the top and bottom.
  - remove redundant content in the text.

my second answer of example on P30: 
  - right top one
    - use various width so central alignment is more clear.
    - use a different font so it isn't long and big.
    - the font is cute.
  - left bottom one
    - background figure is interesting.
    - use various width so central alignment is more clear.
    - reduce the font size.
  - right bottom
    - add a text background.
    - use various width so central alignment is more clear.
    - background figure is interesting.

reference answer:
  - right top one
    - use various width so central alignment is more clear.
    - use a different font so it isn't long and big.
    - the font is cute.
    - spacing between is consistent.
  - left bottom one
    - background figure is interesting.
    - alignment is obviously central align.
    - reduce the font size.
  - right bottom
    - add a text background.
    - ~~use various width so central alignment is more clear.~~(I thought it should have!)
    - background figure is interesting.
    - font-weight is strong, so it looks strong.

my second answer of example on P37:
  - [x] unified width of items.
  - [x] put phone numbers in front so there's no discord blank.
  - [x] use `.` rather than `-` to separate phone numbers.
  - [x] use `Â·` instead of `,` to separate location, professional.(half, `remove combination of comma and period`)
  - [x] add blue ribbon background for website.
  - [x] use same spacing between for item details.
  - [x] enlarge the logo.
  - [x] increase font size of title.
  - [x] add picture in the blank.
  - [] use left alignment for all items.
  - [] gather the welcome messages together.
  - [x] half a pound more of serif.(I can only find it on `Woman ...`)

reference answer has two more differences:
  - spell out `Appt`(`Appointments`)
  - increase the font of the website and use uppercase so it becomes more readable.

my second answer of example on P38-39:
  - [x] use 1 em instead of 0.5 inch for indent.
  - [x] remove border of picture and align it with text.
  - [x] use left alignment for subtitle.
  - [x] first paragraph doesn't indent.

reference answer has one more difference:
  - these lines are wide enough, so you can adjust the font to align with both ends.
