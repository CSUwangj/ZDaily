Let's write some notes takes while challenging my self learning.

<!--more-->

Today I've been reading [A Tutorial on Linear and Differential Cryptanalysis](https://www.engr.mun.ca/~howard/PAPERS/ldc_tutorial.pdf).

Not done yet, so I just write some casual notes, which can help to write some more detailed article(at least I wish).



> The cipher that we shall use to present the concepts is a basic Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN). We will focus our discussion on a cipher, illustrated in Figure 1, that takes a 16-bit input block and processes the block by repeating the basic operations of a round four times. Each round consists of (1) substitution, (2) a transposition of the bits (i.e., permutation of the bit positions), and (3) key mixing. This basic structure was presented by Feistel back in 1973 [15] and these basic operations are similar to what is found in DES and many other modern ciphers, including Rijndael.

SPN is really useful.

> a subkey is applied following the last round, ensuring that the last layer of substitution cannot be easily ignored by a cryptanalyst that simply works backward through the last roundâ€™s substitution.

Apart from the advantage of symmetry of processing(symmetry of encryption/decryption), there is a reason to apply subkey at the last round.

It's easy to prove it by induction, I think.
